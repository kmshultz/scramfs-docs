There's no need to dump your database to disk before moving it to the encrypted directoryâ€”you can dump it, encrypt it, and back it up all in one step!

Suppose your database is called `wordpress`, is located at 172.17.0.2, and is accessible via user `wpadmin` and password `foobar`. Here's how to back up and encrypt it:

```
$ mysqldump -h172.17.0.2 -uwpadmin -pfoobar wordpress | scramfs save scramfs://<ALIAS>/wordpress_db_1
```
