This will be the CLI reference. A few thoughts:

* We may want to put this all on one page, rather than have one page per CLI command. It just depends on how detailed we want to get. (i.e. if short descriptions are enough, let's put all commands on one page, cli_commands.md (or just commands.md))

* We should explore auto-generating this CLI reference from comments in the CLI's code. Then we'd want some hook (i.e. CI/CD) to update this docs site any time the devs update those comments, add a new CLI command, etc.
