# Welcome to the ScramFS CLI Cookbook

This is the user's manual for ScramFS CLI, an encryption tool for sysadmins, DevOps Engineers, and SREs who want to store their files, directories, backups, database dumps—any data at all—securely.

The core of this CLI Cookbook is the [Recipes](recipes/), which are brief tutorials on how to backup (encrypt) and restore (decrypt) various data, like MySQL dumps, Wordpress backups, and more. The [Reference](reference/) section has all the details on how ScramFS CLI works under the hood, and the [FAQ](faq/) section should help you with common problems along the way.

But first, a brief primer on ScramFS CLI.
